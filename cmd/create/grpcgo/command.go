here works in a setup of two Github repositories. Call them apischema and
gocode. The workflow generated with the following command is added to the
apischema repository.

    workflow create grpcgo -o xh3b4sd -r gocode

In order to make the workflow function correctly a deploy key is generated
and distributed as follows. The public and private key files are added to the
apischema repository. The public key is added as deploy key with write access
to the gocode repository. Deploy keys and GPG password are generated with the
following command.

    red generate keys -d .github/asset/xh3b4sd/gocode

Generating the deploy keys also generates a GPG password which is used to
decrypt the encrypted private key within the build container of the workflow.
The GPG password needs to be added to the apischema secrets using the
following name.

    RED_GPG_PASS_XH3B4SD_GOCODE
